# Avance

**Status**: The basic prototype is basically complete. More work needs to be done
to actually make this releasable, but I want to move on to another project, so yeah,
I built a fitness app for myself!

Immediate things to improve:
  - Use the Ramer-Douglas-Peuker algorithm to simplify the graph when there are too many data points
  - Make the app work offline
  - Pacakge app into docker container
  - Switch from sqlite to postgresql
  - Fix all the todos in the app
  - Show password button in auth
