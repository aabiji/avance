# Avance

Things to do before the MVP:
- Weight page
    - [ ] Use the Ramer-Douglas-Peuker algorithm to simplify the graph when there are too many data points
- What to do when the requests fail? Or in other words, how to support offline usage?
- Backend
    - [ ] Switch from sqlite to postgresql
    - [ ] Package app into docker container
- Misc
    - Fix all the todos in the app
    - Change the app name from "frontend" to "avance"
