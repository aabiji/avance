# Avance

Things to do before the MVP:
- Weight page -> should we use a custom graph implementation???
    - [ ] Use an algorithm to simplify the graph when there are too many data points
- What to do when the requests fail? (or the user has slow wifi??)
- Backend
    - [ ] Switch from sqlite to postgresql
    - [ ] Package app into docker container
