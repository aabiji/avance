TODO: put a screenshot here and improve the readme

Immediate things to improve:
  - I still don't like the ui. Do another styling overhaul -- this time the background should be white.
    Should look like MacroTracker
  - Use the Ramer-Douglas-Peuker algorithm to simplify the graph when there are too many data points
  - Start planning the calorie tracking feature
  - Fix all the todos in the app
  - Refactor index.ts
  - TODO: what if we want to change the name of an existing exercise???
  - TODO: test with multiple users
  - TODO: test, test, test!!!!

Setup:
1. Run backend with `sudo docker compose up`. Cleanup with `sudo docker system prune`
2. Run frontend with `bun install && bunx expo start`
3. TODO: build frontend app apk
4. TODO: create the secrets file and put the required files
